# chromeDashboard
##### A self-made dashboard for google chrome

This is designed to be a home page which can be set in the google chrome settings but can also be set as the default new tab location using [This](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-new-tab-url/mmjbdbjnoablegbkcklggeknkfcjkjia) Chrome extension.

It features a
light *(Default)* and dark mode, accessed at the bottom right using a button. Currently this does not save states between sessions
as I have no way to differentiate between users so it would be consistent between every user.

In the future when I have a bit more spare time I intend to add more space and categorized button sets.
